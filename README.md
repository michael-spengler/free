This project fosters decentralization and peer 2 peer collaboration. 

## Frontend
To combine the best of angular, vue and react I use [svelte](https://svelte.dev/).   
Basics: https://www.w3schools.com 

## Backend
The backend code of this project consists of smart contracts written in solidity.  
Those smart contracts shall be deployed on blockchains which guarantee that the underlying PoS assets are provided within adequate economic and social incentive structures to secure the network by keeping it sufficiently decentralized and ethically well aligned. At the time of writing this it seems that the Ethereum (PoS) Blockchain is one of those blockchains. Layer 2 scaling solutions which rely e.g. on Ethereum (PoS) as Layer 1 like Polygon zkEVM seem also trustworthy as far as I can see atm.
